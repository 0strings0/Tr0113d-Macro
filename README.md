# Trolled-4.0 - Registry Computer Defualt Exploit
Trolled 4.0 is a macro designed to implement and improve on trolled 3.0 and cause priviledge escalation. It works on the latest version of windows 10 and 11 as of writing. Using this also does not require exe priviledges. You will need to have the ability to run vbscripts though.

## How It Works

Trolled exploits a common vulnerability in certain systems that allows unauthorized escalation of privileges by use of "computerdefualts.exe" (They Seriously need to fix this file istg). It uses the registry to edit some common paths to run computerdefualts which then creates a shortcut for admin prompt.

## How To Use
First, simply run the vbscript on your system it will then create the registry files. Then, open computerdefualts.exe which is located in ``C:/System32/computerdefualts.exe``. A admin shell will then open up.
